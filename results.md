title: Cluster validation
---

As a first approach to the functional dark side of the metagenomes we used marine samples that will provide a comprehensive view of the microbial communities in different ocean regions and at various depths. We combined the predicted ORFs of four of the major marine mega-sequencing projects:

-   **Global Ocean Sampling expedition (GOS):** 80 samples at 70 different sampling sites for a total of ~20 million predicted ORFs
-   **Tara Oceans expedition (TARA):** 242 samples at 141 different locations for a total of ~112 million predicted ORFs
-   **Malaspina:** 116 samples at 30 different stations for a total of ~22 million predicted ORFs
-   **Ocean Sampling Day (OSD):** 146 samples at 139 different locations for a total of ~7 million predicted ORFs

|  Project  | Samples | Stations |         ORFs        |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :-----------------: |
|    TARA   |   242   |    141   | 111,903,261 (70.1%) |
| Malaspina |   116   |    30    |  20,574,033 (12.9%) |
|    OSD    |   150   |    139   |   7,015,383 (4.4%)  |
|    GOS    |    80   |    70    |  20,068,580 (12.6%) |
| **Total** | **588** |  **380** |   **159,561,257**   |

> At the moment we also included the data from the Human Microbiome Project v2, **1249** metagenomes and **162,687,295** predicted ORFs. In overall we used **322,248,552** predicted ORFs

## Protein clusters of unknown function

The analysis of the first marine dataset resulted in:

|     Categories    |   Knowns   | Genomic unknowns | Environmental unknowns | Knowns without Pfam |
