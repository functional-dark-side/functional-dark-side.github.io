title: Categories of unknowns
---

We defined initially three categories of _unknowns_ (might be more in the future) trying to combine an ecological and a protein domain based approach to their definition. The categories are defined as follow:

-   **KNOWN**: Our **knowns** are all those ORFs that contains a Pfam domain. We are developing an approach to assign function to the unknown ORFs that relies on Domain Co-cocurrence Networks and uses Pfam as a basic buiding block.

-   **GENOMIC UNKNOWNS**: The first categories of unknowns are those ORFs with unknown function but associated to a sequenced organism. This category would be an equivalent to the _FUnkFams_ described by [Wyman et al. 2017](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/23/207985)

-   **ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNS**: The second category of unkwnowns are those  ORFs with unknown function, which cannot be associated to an organism and are found only in environmental metagenomes

-   **GENOMIC POPULATION UNKNOWNS**: The third category of unkwnowns are those environmental unknowns that have been identified in population genomes (aka Metagenome Assembled Genomes) and now we have a genomic context. Those are candidates to become a genomic unknown in the future.
